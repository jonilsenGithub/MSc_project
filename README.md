# MSc_project

### unused_attempts:
Contains 3 models attempted. However, due to various reasons specified in dissertation paper, paragraph VIII, they could not be deployed.

### models:
#### euclidean_distance.ipynb:
Displays the creation of the euclidean distance model deployed in flask_euc.py

#### machine_learning.ipynb:
Displays the creation of both KNN and SVC deployed in flask_ml.py.

Structure:
- Dataset was processed

- KNN was applied
- GridSearch was performed to determine the best parameter combination for KNN
- Cross-validation was used to determine what average accuracy score is using several different combinations of trainingset and testset

- SVC was applied
- GridSearch was performed to determine the best parameter combination for SVC
- Cross-validation was also to determine what average accuracy score is using several different combinations of trainingset and testset
